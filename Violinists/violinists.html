            <p>Midori Goto was a Japanese American child prodigy, who made her first performance
            at 6 years old and is famous for her debut with the New York Philharmonic under Zubin Mehta 
            when she was only 11 years old. At aged 14, she played with Leonard Bernstein at
            Tanglewood, where he famously knelt before her in awe at her performance. She currently chairs the 
            Strings Department at USC's Thornton School of Music.

            <p>Ruggiero Ricci is an American violinist mostly known for his recordings of the works of Paganini 
            (see #<a href="one">1</a>). Like Midori (#<a href="ten">10</a>) and many of the others
            on this list, he had his public debut at an early age. At ten years old he performed 
            the works by Wieniawski and Vieuxtemps and became known as a child prodigy. Ricci has been a prolific 
            performer, with over 6,000 concerts in 65 countries and over 500 recordings before
            his death at the age of 94.</p>

            <p>Nathan Milstein grew up in the Russian Empire (now Ukraine), where he began
            his violin studies at the age of 7. At age 11, he studied under Leopold Auer 
            at the St. Petersburg Conservatory and then Eugène Ysaÿe in Belgium. In 1929,
            he made his American debut with Leopold Stokowski and the Philadelphia Orchestra.
            He eventually settled in New York and became and American citizen. Milstein is
            considered one of the greatest violinists of the past century and only retired
            in his mid 80s after a severe hand injury.</p>

           teaching himself to play on a toy fiddle until he was of age to be accepted into the 
            Shulamit Conservatory and at the Academy of Music in Tel Aviv. He also contracted 
            polio at age four but by the age of 10, he gave his first recital, playing the 
            violin while seated. He has appeared on The Ed Sullivan Show twice in 1958, 
            made his debut at Carnegie Hall in 1963 and toured extensively, including the 
            White House and the New York Philharmonic. He has also been featured as a soloist
            on a number of film scores, such as the very well-known theme of Schindler's List

            <p>Friedrich "Fritz" Kreisler, an Austrian-born violinist, is widely considered
            one of the greatest violinists of all time. He studied at the Vienna Conservatory
            and in Paris, making his United States debut at Steinway Hall in New York City
            on November 10, 1888. Like many great success stories, he became discouraged after
            being rejected for a position in the Vienna Philharmonic. He actually left music
            to study medicine and was in the army for awhile before returning to playing
            the violin in 1899, for the Berlin Philharmonic. In 1943, he became a naturalized 
            citizen of the U.S., where he lived for the rest of his life, giving his last 
            public concert in 1947.</p>

            <p>Yehudi Menuhin was an American violinist of Jewish descent, who began learning
            violin at age four with Sigmund Anker. Like many of these other great violinist,
            he made his public debut at a young age. At only seven, he played with the San 
            Francisco Symphony Orchestra. During World War II, he played for the Allied 
            soldiers, with piano accompaniment by the famous English composer Benjamin Britten.
            Despite his Jewish background, he was one of the first Jewish performers to return
            to Germany to perform, in the wake of the Holocaust. In 1947, he played with the
            Berlin Philharmonic under Wilhelm Furtwängler, standing up to Jewish critics
            and insisting that he wished to restore Germany's spirit through music.</p>

            <p>Isaac Stern was a Soviet-born violinist who was taught violin by his mother,
            until he then enrolled at the San Francisco Conservatory of Music in 1928. His
            public debut was at age 15, for the San Francisco Symphony under Pierre Monteux. 
            He began collaborating with Russian-born pianist Alexander Zakin in 1940, a 
            relationship that would continue until 1977. Stern was celebrated for his recordings, 
            including concertos by Bach, Beethoven, Mendelssohn, and Tchaikovsky, and the more 
            modern works of Bartók, Stravinsky and Bernstein. Stern is also legendary for 
            discovering new young talent, including cellist Yo-Yo Ma and violinist Itzhak Perlman.</p>

            age of six. He studied at In 1914, at the age of six, Oistrakh performed his debut concert. 
            He entered the Odessa Conservatory in 1923 and graduated in 1926. In 1927, Oistrakh
            moved to Moscow, where he eventually taught and became a professor at the Moscow Conservatory.
            During World War II, he was an active performer in the Soviet Union and became
            close friends with Shostakovich and Sergei Prokofiev. The Soviet Union would not
            let him leave the country to perform abroad. However, of all of the violinist on this
            list, he played in the most heroic conditions, playing for soldiers on the front lines.
            Perhaps his most praiseworthy act was a full performance of Tchaikovsky's violin 
            concerto during the Battle of Stalingrad in the winter of 1942, during one of the 
            bloodiest battles in world history. After the war ended, he was finally allowed
            to leave the Soviet Union and even made it to the west, including France and the U.S.

            <br><br>
            <p>Jascha Heifetz was a Lithuanian violinist who learned basic bowing and fingering
            techniques before he was 3 years old. By 5 years old, he was taking official lessons
            and he made his public debut by seven, playing the Violin Concerto in E minor by Felix Mendelssohn.
            He played at the Saint Petersburg Conservatory, Germany and Scandinavia. He met Kreisler
            (see above #<a href="six">6</a>) in Berlin. Kreisler was greatly impressed by the youngster. 
            He continued to receive rave reviews throughout Europe and when he moved to the U.S. as a teen, 
            the audience was ecstatic about his debut at Carnegie Hall. Most critics would agree that 
            Heifetz's technical abilities on the violin are incomparable. He invented a modern, new style
            of violin playing, with rapid vibrato and dramatically emotional use of portamento. Heifetz had
            a long and meaningful career and even after a shoulder injury prevented him from playing,
            he continued to teach in California, until his death.</p>

            <br><br>
            <p>Even to the layperson, Paganini's name is synonymous with great violin playing.
            An Italian violinist and composer, Paganini learned mandolin first, from his father, 
            at the age of five. At seven, he moved on to violin and quickly excelled at it. After
            a breakthrough 1813 concert at La Scala in Milan, he became famous enough to tour 
            Europe, hitting every major city capital, from Poland to Britain. He suffered from 
            a variety of health conditions throughout his life, from depression to Marfan syndrome. 
            However, like  Heifetz (#<a href="two">2</a>), when playing became too much for him, he took on students. His 
            impressive dexterity in fingering and bow techniques were frowned upon at the time by his contemporaries
            but renewed interest in these stylish techniques. Because of his talent and a
            slightly bawdy lifestyle, he was widely rumored to have an association with the devil.
            This rumor plagued him even after his death. It took the Church 4 years and an appeal
            to the Pope to allow his body to be transported from his death in Nice
            to his home in Genoa and 32 more years until his body was finally laid to rest.
