                    <p>At the conclusion of my Girl Develop It course in videogame design, I realized I should write a blog post about gamification. I had mistakenly thought that this was a synonym for game development, but gamification is actually defined as the process of taking game mechanics to drive engagement in non-gaming platforms. This makes it one of the trendiest concepts in UX right now. The burning question is how to make learning fun and to increase user engagement. For instance, WordPress rewards its users with “CubePoints”, where they can earn virtual credits by posting comments, creating posts, or even just logging in. Other examples of gamification include leaderboards, badges and giveaways. Gamification is not only used in the online domain, but also to teach and entertain in places like classrooms and museums. However, since my blog addresses online platforms, I’ll move on to examining the psychology of reward used in videogaming and gamification.</p>

                    <p>Videogame developers understand that there are two major elements used to motivate users: feedback loops and progressive challenges. Feedback loops are the scores, Likes or scoreboard positions that motivate users to repeatedly perform an action. Progressive challenges allow users to feel undaunted at the commencement of the game but challenged as they continue to play. A good game keeps users interested without feeling overwhelmed. In previous blog entries, I have already discussed the powerful neuropsychology behind motivation and learning. So I will move on, with an example from the gaming world.  There are many “freemium” games where users will download the game for free but then pay for in-game tools, in order to stay competitive. This may sound like a dicey business model but in actual fact, Freemium games can make a lot of money. Users get addicted surprisingly easily and will continue to pay for in-game purchases or pay an annual fee to keep playing competitively.</p>

                    <p>Gamification techniques use techniques similar to actual videogames, tapping into a user’s desire for competition, achievement and socializing, striving to create a “gameful experience.” But there has also been criticism of the concept of gamification. A phrase came up in class, that you “can’t put chocolate on broccoli.” In other words, you can’t just put a nice thing on an insipid thing and expect users to stay engaged. Just because a dull website tacks on a fun personality quiz doesn’t mean that users will feel entertained enough to stay on the website. Some suggest that gamification is just a fluffy business model that reassures marketing people that they’re doing something productive. Video game designer Ian Bogost’s <a href="http://bogost.com/writing/blog/gamification_is_bullshit/">famous commentary</a>, entitled “Gamification is Bullshit” discusses how gamification is a contemporary  buzzword and marketing “bullshit trend”.</p>
                    <p>One of our discussions in class, was that when gamification is not done properly, it is simply not fun for the user. However, when done correctly, research reviews show an overall positive effect. I would like to conclude by mentioning a few examples where gamification was used very effectively on websites. Samsung created Samsung Nation, a social reward program where users win badges by reviewing products, watching videos and participating in Q&A. Brand loyalty is reinforced and users are encouraged to engage socially. Similarly, Verizon Wireless created Verizon Insider, where customers earn points through writing reviews and community interactions. Nissan made the Carwings Program, where users not only earn rewards but can charge the battery, set timers, turn on the A/C and more, using their smartphone. Finally, Dropbox deserves a mention, because when users sign up for free, they get 2GB of storage, but they can earn an extra 250MB just by taking a tour of Dropbox’s services and can earn 125MB by connecting their account to Twitter or Facebook, following Dropbox on Twitter or leaving feedback. They also get 500MB  for referring a friend, again making clever use of a user’s desire to socialize.</p>
                    <p>Gamification may be a fad, but it is a fad that is worth taking note of. In 2013, over 70% of Forbes Global 2000 companies surveyed said that they planned to use gamification for marketing purposes. While gamification is not a panacea to make a website or application engaging, when used well, it will positively impact user experience and loyalty.</p>
