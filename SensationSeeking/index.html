	<h2>What is the sensation seeking personality trait?</h2>
	<p>Sensation-seeking is a consistent pattern of behavior where people prefer strong sensory
	stimulation and a diversity of experiences/sensations. The search for these feelings 
	and experiences often (but not always) involves some element of risk.</p> 
	<p>There are 4 different identifiable types of sensation-seeking:</p> 
    <ul>
    <li>Thrill and adventure seeking: people who take an interest in extreme sports like skydiving
    or white water rafting.</li>
    <li>Experience seeking: people who seek out unfamiliar and complex environmental stimulation e.g. by
    meeting new people or travelling on their own.</li>
    <li>Disinhibition: people who enjoy losing their inhibitions, such as by getting drunk 
    and using drugs.</li>
    <li>Boredom Susceptibility: people who dislike routines and pursue change for change's sake.</li>
    </ul>

     <h3>Mostly A's</h3><p><span class="spoiler">It sounds like you're a sensation-seeker. 
     You thrive on change and excitement, 
    whether it is gambling, meeting new people, skydiving or watching horror
    movies. You crave exciting new experiences and the casting off of inhibitions. Risk-taking
    is a byproduct of this sensation-seeking behaviour. You should be aware that satisfying 
    the need for certain feelings may lead to engaging in risky behaviors such as unsafe sex 
    or reckless driving. However, risk-taking was obviously adaptive in human evolution and 
    without people like you, there would be no explorers and no new discoveries.</span></p>
    
    <h3>Mostly B's</h3><p><span class="spoiler">You are probably not a sensation-seeker. You would rather stick with
    familiar behaviors and people than step out of your comfort-zone. However, the world needs
    both kinds of people. Humanity would have never emigrated all over the world without sensation-
    seekers but if you take too many risks, you may die before you have the chance to spread
    your genes around.</span></p>
